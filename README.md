# SimpleEditor

A drop-in JavaScript textarea replacement for writing Markdown, HTML, javascript, CSS.

SimpleEditor is based on [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/NextStepWebs/simplemde-markdown-editor) with the following features:

- Toolbar dropdown buttons
- Allows to toggle between Markdown and HTML editing mode


## Why rename the project instead of send pull request

The original SimpleMDE and by the name itself is focus on and only Markdown support.
While I need more then just Markdown, it's a different direction and may not suitable for asking a pull request.

## Why not a WYSIWYG editor or pure Markdown?

WYSIWYG editors are messes, however Markdown is not enough for advanced HTML usage when you need more attributes or such chaos.
