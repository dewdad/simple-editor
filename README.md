# SimpleEditor

A drop-in JavaScript textarea replacement for writing Markdown, HTML, javascript, CSS.

SimpleEditor is based on [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/NextStepWebs/simplemde-markdown-editor) with the following features:

- Toolbar dropdown buttons
- Allows to toggle between Markdown and HTML editing mode

## Why not a WYSIWYG editor or pure Markdown?

WYSIWYG editors are messes, however Markdown is not enough for advanced HTML usage when you need more attributes or custom.
